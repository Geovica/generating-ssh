This is a simple guide to generate ssh keys


To generate an SSH key pair using the terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal application on your computer.

2. Type the following command to start the key generation process:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
Here, `-t rsa` specifies the type of key to generate, and `-b 4096` sets the number of bits in the key. You can adjust the key type and length as per your requirements.

3. You will be prompted to enter a file path for the key pair. Simply press Enter to accept the default path (`/Users/your-username/.ssh/id_rsa`).

4. Next, you will be asked to enter a passphrase. It is recommended to set a passphrase to add an extra layer of security to your SSH key. Type in a passphrase or leave it blank if you wish to have a passphrase-less key (not recommended).

5. Once you've entered the passphrase (or left it blank), the key generation process will begin. You will see a progress bar indicating the generation process.

6. Once the key pair is generated, you will find two files in the specified file path: `id_rsa` (private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (public key).

Congratulations, you have successfully generated an SSH key pair using the terminal! The private key (`id_rsa`) should be kept secure and not shared, while the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) can be freely distributed to remote servers for authentication purposes.


# copying-ssh
To copy the contents of your SSH public key (`id_rsa.pub`) using the terminal, you can use the `pbcopy` command on macOS or the `xclip` command on Linux. Here are the commands:

For macOS:
```
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

For Linux (with Xclip installed):
```
xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

After running the respective command, the contents of your SSH public key will be copied to the clipboard. You can then paste it into a text file, text editor, or directly into the authorized_keys file on the remote server.

Alternatively, if you prefer to output the contents to the terminal to manually copy them, you can use the `cat` command like this:
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Running this command will display the contents of your SSH public key in the terminal, and you can manually select and copy it.
